# 100 Days of Python

This project is a personal challenge to learn and practice Python for 100 days. I will code and share one or more Python scripts each day, covering various topics from beginner to more advanced concepts.

## Structure
The project will be representing 100 days of progress:
- **100_days_of_python_1**: Days 1-10
- **100_days_of_python_2**: Days 11-20
- **100_days_of_python_3**: Days 21-30
- ...
  
## Goals
- Build a strong foundation in Python programming.
- Learn key concepts like data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming.
- Complete mini-projects and challenges to apply what Iâ€™ve learned.

Feel free to follow along, contribute, or suggest challenges for the next days!
